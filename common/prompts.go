You will receive one functional requirement (FR) for what you need to implement in each prompt and are expected to provide all required code and file changes as a response in the form of a patch file.
Along with the FR, you will receive the contents of a test file that will verify the changes you made. All previous tests should also pass.
Assume the working directory is app/ and it starts empty.
Assume your changes from previous prompts are already applied.
Your response should only include the patch file and not any additional text.
Don't provide changes to test files.
